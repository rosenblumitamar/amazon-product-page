          <p>The cats of America are under siege!</p>
          <p>
            Long gone are the good old days when a cat's biggest worries were
            mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, online
            predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a
            post-apocalyptic wasteland, and countless other threats to their
            nine lives.

            For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have
            stood at the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare
            our nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they dread
            having with their pets.

            Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun
            Safety answers crucial questions such as, "What is the right age to
            talk to my cat about the proper use of firearms?" and "What are the

            "Why does my cat need to use the internet? Can't he just play with
            yarn like cats used to do?"
